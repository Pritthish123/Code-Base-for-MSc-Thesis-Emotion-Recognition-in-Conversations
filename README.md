Task of Emotion Recognition in Conversations 
This github link consists of the attention based BiERU code named as Attention_Based_BiERU_model. It also consists of the python notebooks of statistical analysis, 
and accuracy and loss plots. 
The folder named Output consists of sub folders and each of the sub folders consisits of all the screenshots related to that particular folder.
I have tried to include all possible outputs to the best of my knowledge. 
The file can be executed in terminal by running the Attention_Based_BiERU_model.ipynb file as a py file with the command python Attention_Based_BiERU_model.py.
Please note for running the files data should be approved beforehand and all the necessary libraries as mentioned in the Attention_Based_BiERU_model.ipynb file 
should be installed.
